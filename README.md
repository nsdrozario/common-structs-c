# Common Structures for C

This is a library that has implementations for common data structures, intended for use in the C language.

## Currently supported structures
- [x] `vector` (incomplete)
- [] `set`
- [] `map`
- [] `graph`
- [] `tree`
- [] `union_find`
- [] `queue`
- [] `stack`
- [] `priority_queue`
- [] `deque`
- [] `linked_list`

## Usage in C++
You can use this library in C++, but you probably should just use the C++ STL instead. It'll likely have more efficient implementations than
this library, and it's there for you to use anyway. However, you shouldn't use this library and the C++ STL at the same time, because you'll likely encounter name conflicts.

## Purpose
I am writing this library mainly as an exercise for understanding data structures more in-depth.
